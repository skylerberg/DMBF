Items are catagorized into different rarity classes as specified in rarityLevel.txt
Files with item rarities in them should be written with each line in the following form
ITEM:RARITY LEVEL
e.g.: Spear:very common
To convert a file from this form into a raffle file, run the toRaffle script with a file as an argument
